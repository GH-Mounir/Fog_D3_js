This is a research project under the research unit InnoV'Com Lab - Sup'Com Tunisia, that demonstrates the conversion of a Folium-generated map to an interactive D3.js map. If you are facing issues with large Folium map file sizes, this approach may help optimize and provide more flexibility using D3.js.

## Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Understand D3.js:** Familiarize yourself with D3.js and its documentation.
2. **Extract Data:** Extract necessary data from the Folium map for use in D3.js.
3. **Recreate Map in D3.js:** Use D3.js to recreate the map visualization with interactivity.
4. **Optimize Data and Resources:** Optimize data and resources to reduce the overall file size.
5. **Integrate with Existing Web Page:** Embed the D3.js map within your existing web page.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the D3.js map.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file where D3.js code is implemented.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
